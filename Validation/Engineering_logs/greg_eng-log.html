Today we had a team meeting from 1-3pm in McKeldin Library. At this meeting we determined what parts of the proposal
needed to be finished or fixed, and assigned those pieces to team members, to be completed by 11pm on Monday.
We also split the product build into piece for each team to focus on. My team, 10, was assigned to work on the
database and account management systems.
</P>
<P>
Individually, I was assigned to turn the current competitor analysis in the proposal into a paragraph format
that compares the competitor products to ours. Also, I am to add screenshots for each of the competitors
main layouts.
</P>

<U><B>October 20, 2013:</B></U>
<P>
Today I completed my individual task. I rewrote the competitor analysis for the propsal to paragraph from and
compared each competitor product to our build. I also included screenshots of each competitor product.
</P>

Today in class we determined the final pieces of the propsal that need to be completed and assigned them to
team members. We are aiming to deliver the proposal on Thursday of this week.
</P>
<P>
Individually, I was assigned to clean up the competitors section and add short captions to describe the screenshots.
I completed this individual task today as well. My next task for this week is to start implementing and designing how
to set up a login system and the database we will use for the tasker.
</P>

Today our team finished the first working version of a log in (account) system for the terp tasker. A few issues involved
matching hashes and we discussed with the rest of the group a few things that need to be changed for security purposes.
</P>
<P>
Individually, I am to work with Eyobe on the database and login system. Including coordinating access to the accounts data
for other groups, like the the webpage designer for example.
</P>

On Thursday we had a group meeting in class and divided up even further assignments. I am still working on database and 
account management/loging, mainly with Eyobe. Today we were asked to figure a way to add a 'captcha' to the login process
and to also create a page to deal with password retrieval via email.
</P>

<U><B>November 4, 2013:</B></U>
<P>
I inserted a working recaptcha form on the main Bootstrap registration page. A script handles the captcha generation on the 
HTML file and verifys through the server registration script. Now I have to start creating a admin account system that will
allow a user to login and have the ability to add and remove users.
</P>

<U><B>November 15, 2013:</B></U>
<P>
We agreed on a schema for every part of the database except the calendar. We still need to figure this part out. My group is
going to implement the database on the server using this schema and MySQL. Afterwards we will implement the rest of the website
functionality.
</P>

<U><B>November 20, 2013:</B></U>
<P>
Today I set up the MySQL database on the VM. Formatting was an issue I resolved for consistency and there are some relations
that were incomplete in the schema. Those will be added in when those modules have all of the information required figured out.
This took about 1.5 hrs to set up. I need to add the remaining relations also for the ToDoList, for that groups module.
</P>

<U><B>November 23, 2013:</B></U>
<P>
Created a delete_task.php that when passed a taskID will remove that row of the task table. When logged in a user can now
delete a task they have created. The front end build will pass the taskID to this backend php function. I also started working
on a function to allow users to edit tasks. Not finished this yet, having trouble with getting the Update query to pass values
from the POST. I also need to next work on creating admin account and setting  new registration to a default non-admin value 
in the members table of the database. Todays work took about 3 hours to figure out. Clarification of the new database schema
is needed for us to migrate our function to it and to implement the remainder of the database functionality, as that is my
groups primary role of the product build.

We had a meeting today at 7pm. We went through all the things we have completed over break and all of the things we still
need to accomplish by Thursday, which is when we have our walkthrough. Today I finished the administrator account actions. 
My group still needs to write a config file for user set up, fix the delete your account function, add contexts automatically
when a new user is registered. Todays work took about 5 hours. A few places need to be changed to prepared statements and
a hidden field for admin actions need to be created for when an admin logs in they can see it, but others can't. 
</P>

Last day before walk through. I completed a few small tasks, such as adding pre-set contexts and a preset category when a new
user registers an account. The 'Delete Your Account' function in the settings is now working properly after me and Matt fixed
it. Tonight my group (Team 10) had a group chat online about our last tasks and what we did/did not complete. We completed 
everything we were asked to do on the database side, login, SSL and config file. Our meeting also decided what we would talk 
about in the presentation. Eyobe and I will be discussing the database setup/use/integration. The code fixes I performed took
approximately 1 hour and the meeting we held also took about 1 hour.

Last night we had a team meeting to discuss the validation exercises. We made sure that everyone had a test subject with an
android phone that could complete the validation test before Thursday. We also discussed the cost analysis and drew a sketch
of the architectural design of the project to help with each teams cost analysis. Team 10 had a meeting over online 
conference to begin work on our cost analysis. We divided up the different parts so everyone had a part to complete and
we could complete the task faster and with better quality. The team meeting took about 1.5 hours and the team 10 meeting
took about another 1.5 hours.
