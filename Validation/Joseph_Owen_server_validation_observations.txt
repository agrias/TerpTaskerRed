apt-get Apache 2 installs the wrong version
	asked if we used apt-get for everything
	be more specific about library or package names
	links would be preferred to just a dependency list
asked to instead be given a script that creates the database for you instead of having to type in all the commands by hand
ideally, the config file should have been a makefile
	would at least put the website in its directory and set up the database
schema should NOT be an image!
	schema also had errors, like typos and missing types
	schema also did not match database exactly --> sent Joseph a modified version of the DESCRIBE outputs for each table, saved as validation_schema.txt
other SQL issue: Call_History has 2 primary keys
needed to specify username & password for database connection
after Joseph wrote a Python script to generate the mySQL calls, database and website were both working
