TASKER RED

Generally a nice description of the problem to be solved, but the model text (which needs to
be the sharpest) is a single long paragraph that runs on, and does not reflect the value of
iterative refinement through our drafting process.  Much other language remains loose and 
unpolished. ("When the user works on a task, they can....")  *

I'm glad for the tradeoff analysis. It is a good list of related products for differentiation,
though since our proposed edge is not sharply defined before that point, the comparison comes
off as soft - we can't see why (just to pick one) we aren't using Lighting plugin, for example.

Promises to implement "as many of those features [listed later] as possible." Oops. Not sharp.

The model/language snit is worth a minor defect. Under most circumstances I would not accept
an open-ended 'as many as possible' obligation, but there are other aspects to this which I 
like, and I don't want to slow things down badly at this point. I will count that as a couple
minor defects (rather than a major one, which would have been 10 points), and give a conditional
green light on presumption that you will promptly give me a crisp list of features which you will
commit to implementing (and that I agree.) 91
